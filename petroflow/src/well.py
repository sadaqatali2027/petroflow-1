class Well(AbstractWell, metaclass=SegmentDelegatingMeta):
    """A class, representing a well.

    A well consists of segments - instances of `WellSegment` class,
    representing a contiguous part of a well. Initially an instance of `Well`
    class has a single segment, containing information about the whole well.
    Subsequently, several `Well` methods, such as `crop`, `random_crop` or
    `drop_nans`, increase the number of segments, storing them in a tree-based
    structure.

    All methods, declared in `AbstractWell` and not overridden in `Well` will
    be created by `SegmentDelegatingMeta` metaclass. These methods will
    delegate the call to each segment of the well in various ways, depending
    on the corresponding value in the `delegators` dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or None
        If `None`, `Well` will be created from `segments`. If `str`, a path to
        a directory with well data, containing:
        - `meta.json` - a json dict with the following keys:
            - `name` - well name
            - `field` - field name
            - `depth_from` - minimum depth entry in the well logs (in cm)
            - `depth_to` - maximum depth entry in the well logs (in cm)
          These values will be stored as segment attributes.
        - `samples_dl` and `samples_uv` (optional) - directories, containing
          daylight and ultraviolet images of core samples respectively. Images
          of the same sample must have the same name in both dirs.
        - Optional `.csv`, `.las` or `.feather` file for certain segment
          attributes (see more details in the `WellSegment.Attributes`
          section).
    core_width : positive float, optional
        The width of core samples in cm. Defaults to 10 cm.
    pixels_per_cm : positive float, optional
        The number of pixels in cm used to determine the loaded width of core
        sample images. Image height is calculated so as to keep the aspect
        ratio. Defaults to 5 pixels.
    validate : bool, optional
        Specifies whether to check well data for correctness and consistency.
        Slightly reduces processing speed. Defaults to `True`.
    segments : list of WellSegment or Well instances or None, optional
        Segments to put into `segments` attribute. Usually is used by methods
        which increase the tree depth. If `None`, `path` must be defined.

    Attributes
    ----------
    segments : list of WellSegment or Well instances or None
        A segment tree of the well. All leave nodes are instances of
        `WellSegment` class, representing a contiguous part of a well. All
        other tree nodes are instances of `Well` class.
